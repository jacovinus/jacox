# 🧠 The Jacox Philosophy

Because why trust a multi-billion dollar corporation with your data when you can trust a single `.db` file on your laptop?

### 1. The Cloud is Just Someone Else's Space Heater
We believe that sending your private thoughts to a server farm in Oregon is a great way to warm up the planet, but a terrible way to keep a secret. Jacox is built on the wild assumption that your local CPU is actually capable of doing work.

### 2. Form Over Function (But Usually Both)
If a tool doesn't look like it belongs in a high-budget sci-fi movie, does it even exist? We follow the **Monokai-Gruvbox** lifestyle: if it isn't slightly moody and extremely high-contrast, it isn't worth building.

### 3. The Cult of Rust
We use Rust because we enjoy the thrill of fighting a borrow checker for three hours just to avoid a memory leak that would have taken five minutes to fix in Python. It’s about the *moral superiority* of zero-cost abstractions.

### 4. Minimalist Over-Engineering
We believe in keeping things simple by using a multi-threaded, asynchronous, analytical database engine (DuckDB) just to store your "Hello World" messages. Why use a list when you can use a relational database with vectorized execution?
