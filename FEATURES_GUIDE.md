# Jacox: Features & Usage Guide 📘

This guide provides a deep-dive into every capability of the Jacox LLM Server, including real-world examples and architectural use cases.

---

## 1. Multi-Provider LLM Engine 🧠
Jacox abstracts away the differences between various LLM providers, allowing you to switch between cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic) and local (Ollama) models with a single config change.

### 🛠 Configuration Example
```yaml
llm:
  provider: "ollama"  # Just change this to "openai" or "anthropic"
  model: "mistral"
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Cost Optimization
Develop your application using a local model (Ollama + Mistral) to save costs. Once ready for production, switch to `gpt-4o` or `claude-3-5-sonnet` by simply updating the `provider` and adding your API key to `.env`.

---

## 2. Local Memory Layer (DuckDB) 🦆
Every conversation is persisted in a high-performance, local DuckDB database (`chat.db`). This provides instant history retrieval without the latency or privacy concerns of external vector stores.

### 🛠 CLI Example
```bash
# List all saved sessions from the local database
cargo run -- session list
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Privacy-First Personal Assistant
Build a chat application where data never leaves the user's machine unless it's sent to the LLM. The entire conversation history stays in `chat.db`, allowing for offline indexing and long-term memory.

---

## 3. Real-time WebSocket Streaming ⚡
Jacox supports token-by-token streaming via WebSockets. This provides a "live" feel similar to ChatGPT's interface.

### 🛠 Client Implementation (JS)
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/ws/chat/<SESSION_ID>?api_key=sk-dev-key-123");

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === "chunk") {
        console.log("Token:", data.content);
    }
};
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Real-time IDE Extensions
Integrate Jacox into a VS Code extension where the AI "types" its solution as it thinks, providing immediate feedback to the developer.

---

## 4. OpenAI Compatibility Proxy 🔄
Jacox acts as a drop-in proxy. Any application built for the OpenAI API can point to Jacox to use Ollama or Anthropic instead.

### 🛠 Integration Example (Python)
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",
    api_key="sk-dev-key-123"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="mistral", # This maps to your config.yaml provider
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}]
)
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Legacy Tool Modernization
Take an older tool that only supports OpenAI and "modernize" it to work with local Open Source models (Llama 3, Mistral) by updating the `base_url`.

---

## 5. Session Portability (Import/Export) 📥📤
Export your history to human-readable `.txt` files and import them into any other Jacox instance.

### 🛠 CLI Commands
```bash
# Export
cargo run -- session export <UUID> --path my_chat.txt

# Import
cargo run -- session import --path my_chat.txt
```

### 🌐 REST API Endpoints
- **Export**: `GET /sessions/{id}/export` (Returns plain text with `Content-Disposition` attachment)
- **Import**: `POST /sessions/import` (Send the `.txt` file content as the request body)

### 🎯 Use Case: Context Sharing
Developers can export a complex debugging session with an AI and share the `.txt` file with a teammate. The teammate can import it into their own Jacox instance via the CLI or UI to continue the conversation with the same context.

---

## 6. Interactive Playground 🛝
A built-in dashboard for rapid testing of your local models.

### 🛠 Access
Visit `http://localhost:8080/playground` to see the live chat interface.

### 🎯 Use Case: Model Benchmarking
Quickly switch models in `config.yaml` and test how they handle the same prompts side-by-side using the Playground UI.

---

## 7. Internet Search Tool 🌐
Jacox includes a built-in search tool that uses a custom Rust scraper to fetch grounding data from the web. This allows local models (like Mistral via Ollama) to answer questions about current events.

### 🛠 Example Prompt
"What is the current price of Bitcoin in Euros?"
-> The agent will trigger a `Searching: internet_search...` status and fetch live data.

### 🎯 Use Case: Real-time Grounding
Give your local models access to the "today" without needing a search API subscription (like Brave or Google).

---

## 8. High-Fidelity Data Visualization (Charts) 📊
If an LLM provides a JSON block with `role: "chart"`, Jacox will render it as a premium Recharts visualization.

### 🛠 JSON Format
```json
{
  "role": "chart",
  "type": "line",
  "title": "Bitcoin Trend",
  "data": [
    { "label": "Monday", "values": [50000, 51000, 52000], "subLabels": ["00:00", "08:00", "16:00"] }
  ],
  "xAxis": "label",
  "yAxis": "value"
}
```

### 🎯 Use Case: Financial Analysis
Visualize stock trends, crypto prices, or server telemetry directly in the chat interface with interactive tooltips and granular data buckets.
