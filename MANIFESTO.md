# 📜 The Jacox Manifesto

A declaration of war against latency, centralized control, and ugly user interfaces.

### I. The Death of the Loading Spinner
Waiting for a remote API to tell you it's "thinking" is a relic of a darker age. We demand local-first response times that make your SSD feel like it’s actually earning its keep.

### II. The Sovereignty of the Session
Your chat history is yours. It shouldn't be "mined," "analyzed," or "leveraged for synergistic ad-targeting." If it’s going to be used to train a rogue AI, it should be *your* rogue AI, running on *your* hardware.

### III. Aesthetics as a Human Right
A command-line interface doesn't have to look like a tax return from 1984. We believe in the right to high-fidelity SVG rendering, even when we're just drawing a circle.

### IV. The Local-First Uprising
We stand with the developers who are tired of "Status Pages" telling them their tools are down. If your computer is on, Jacox is up. If the internet dies, we keep chatting. The apocalypse will be localized, but at least the UI will be premium.
