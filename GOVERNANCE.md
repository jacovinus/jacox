# ⚖️ Jacox Governance

How we manage the chaos, one `cargo check` at a time.

### 1. The Benevolent Dictatorship of the Borrow Checker
The Compiler is the ultimate authority. If it doesn't compile, it doesn't exist. There are no "warnings," only delayed errors.

### 2. Feature Request Protocol
1. **The "Does it look cool?" Test**: If a feature doesn't improve the aesthetic of the Monokai-Gruvbox theme, it is immediately discarded.
2. **The "Rust Complexity" Guard**: If a feature can't be implemented using at least three different trait bounds and a lifetime specifier, it's probably too simple for this project.

### 3. Conflict Resolution
In the event of a disagreement, the participant with the most customized `zsh` theme wins. If themes are equally complex, we defer to the person who has the most niche mechanical keyboard switches.

### 4. Transparency
We are 100% transparent about the fact that we have no idea why certain DuckDB queries are as fast as they are. We just assume it’s magic and move on.

### 5. Open Source (Sort Of)
You are free to fork this project, but if you change the theme to Light Mode, you are legally required to delete the repository and rethink your life choices.
