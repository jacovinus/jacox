# 💎 Jacox Principles

The unshakeable laws that hold this `.db` file together.

### 1. Local-First, Cloud-Third
The Cloud is a fallback for when you’ve lost your physical sense of self. Everything starts and ends on the disk.

### 2. Type Safety as an Obsession
If a bug can be caught at compile-time, it should be. If it can’t be, we’ll probably find a way to make it a type error anyway. We don't fix bugs; we make them mathematically impossible.

### 3. Vectorized Thinking
Why process one message when you can process a batch using SIMD instructions? Even if you only have one session, Jacox thinks in parallel. It’s more ambitious than it needs to be.

### 4. The 80/20 Rule of Design
80% of the time should be spent on the CSS and SVG rendering. The remaining 20% can be split between the actual LLM integration and sleeping.

### 5. Error Messages as Literature
An error message should tell a story. Ideally, a tragic one about a lost database connection or a malformed JSON metadata block. "Internal Server Error" is for people who have given up on life.
